# My Personal Site

## Introduction

Welcome to my monorepo for my personal sites and projects.

**Last Updated:** September 2024

## Project Overview

This Monorepo (using Turborepo) serves as my main repo for storing all of my code that I want to be adjacent to my personal website. 


## Project Structure

There are two Next.js apps in this repo right now. My original liam.bio site and my new liamgermain.com site. 

- `/apps/liam.bio`: My orignal personal website hosted on liam.bio
- `/apps/v2`: My new personal site hosted on liamgermain.com


## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the root of the repository
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Contribution

While this is a personal project, I'm open to suggestions and improvements. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have ideas to enhance the site.
